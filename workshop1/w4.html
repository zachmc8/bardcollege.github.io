      "I believe that code is what it is today because of how we define it. Saying anything 
      implicitely can be just like code because you are saying something and then something eles happpens.
      Code can be a disguise for some and clear as day for others." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Heine">Heinrich Heine</a>

      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."
